###Game Context

This game is inspired by the scene in Episode IV: A New Hope when the heroes are fleeing the Death Star. While being chased by Imperial TIE fighters, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo man the turrets on the Millenium Falcon and destroy the fighters. The player plays as one of the heroes on a turret of the Millenium Falcon and must destroy 20 TIE fighters before their health runs out.

###Project Goal

This is the final project for my senior AP Computer Science course. All that was required was to make a 3D virtual reality environment for use with Google's Cardboard or any other goggles that use the a mobile phone. I decided to be a little ambitious and try to make an actual game out of the project and not just a static environment so I made this game inspired by one of my favorite franchises. This was my first time using Unity ever so I apologize if some of the methods used were not conventional. I figure that because I finished it for class but my inexperience with Unity stopped me from making a really polished game, I would put it up on GitHub and let the community take my ground work and make something amazing.

###Compatibility

This is a Unity game designed to be played with Google's Cardboard VR but will work with other VR goggles as long as they utilize a phone as the screen.
